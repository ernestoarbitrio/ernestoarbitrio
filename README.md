**Ciao!** 👋

I am *Ernesto Arbitrio* a 🇮🇹 Software Engineer turned *Senior* Software Engineer when I turned 36 😏.

Maybe we have met each other on Mastodon [@pamaron](https://mastodon.social/@pamaron) or GitHub [@ernestoarbitrio](https://github.com/ernestoarbitrio) before.

Considering I do not use social networks often, so you probably don't know me! Let me introduce myself: I build analytics software products for a living, I started programming Python in 2008, sometimes I do speak at PyCon conferences.


**Personal Projects** 📒

Beside my professional projects I also invest some of my spare time in personal projects:

* [Histolab](https://github.com/histolab/histolab) a library for Digital Pathology Image Processing.
* [Pytest Runner](https://github.com/ernestoarbitrio/pytest-runner) a Visual Studio Code extension useful to run ``pytest`` locally and on a 🐳 docker container.

**Speaking** 📢

I have been speaking for several years at PyCon Italia, PyData and Europython and also some meetups (Pytrento, Python Pizza).
You can find some of the slides for my talks [here](https://speakerdeck.com/pamaron).
